A bucket list and honours project developed and engineered by Jan Huss

For a few years, I have been toying with the thought of building an audio engine. It sounds like an ambitious and daunting tasks just by saying it out loud. But people need to continue understanding an audio engine's architecture and structure so that we can continue making awesome tools for the sound creators!

After winning Dare Academy 2023, 3 friends and I decided to form a company to continue the development of our award winning game **"Book of Abominations"**. And I thought to myself..."What if I could build an audio engine and replace it with the FMOD Studio engine we currently have in place?...."

An amazing opportunity arose in which I could build an audio engine for my honours degree while developing core knowledge and FX implementation for my audio programming module I have running at the same time. The way this will work is as follows:

Honours degree:
- Study the architecture
- Design the engine
- Build the engine bit by bit
- Bind to game framework/library/engine for testing
- Focus on optimisation
- Benchmark against other engines for efficiency

Audio Programming module:
- Study engine structure to implement effects
- Build an effect to demonstrate

So here we are. Ready to tackle this exciting task. This readme will be altered and updated as development progresses.

## Current progress:
- ~~initial stages. Honours project idea submitted~~
- removed initial code and setup a project using **GLFW** and **Dear ImGui**

## Libraries used
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
